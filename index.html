  <h2>Current Projects</h2>
  <p>I'm currently building Sherpa, an AI oral evaluation tool for teachers to scale conversational assessments in the classroom. I'm building this with my best friend Shaurya Sinha, with support from The Piech Lab. You can learn more about Sherpa here (link to be added later).</p>
